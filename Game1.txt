Git bash-used by us
Git sui-not used bcz its for layman and also has less features.
Mkdir space then write namegit-this creates a new folder in c drive users C:/Users/…../….
Ls->It lists all the files present in the folder(folder that is made previously)
cd-> this command is used to change directory and move to previous directory

Way of writing folder
C:/Users/Vibhu(Name)/Project

Task
1.create a folder parentgit
2.create a folder childgit
3.create a folder grandchildgit(use only mkdir,ls,cd)

solution-
first using mkdir create a parentfolder
then using cd command go in that parentfolder
then in that folder using mkdir create a child folder
then using cd command go in child folder
then again continue same process for grandchild folder
