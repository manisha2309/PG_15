        Magic! You'll send your unique Postable link to your friends and family and the link will then take them to a new page with your address request form on it. Once your contacts fill out the form with their info, it will magically appear in your free Postable address book. Voila

    <div class="question">
        How can I organize my Address Book?
    </div>
    <div class="answercont">
      <div class="answer">
        This free online address book doesn't just look snazzy, it helps keep everything neatly organized too. There's two main ways your contacts can be organized: Alphabetical order As soon as you start entering contacts, you'll see that the address book is organized automatically by alphabetical order. Just click on the letter to find the contact you're looking for. You can choose to have this ordered by first name or last name by going to your Account Settings > Address Book settings. Groups You can also organize your address book by grouping your contacts. For example, you can combine all of your co-workers into a 'work buddies' group or all of your bridesmaids into their own 'BridesMaids' group. Place contacts into multiple groups or leave them out completely â€” it's totally up to you. Go ahead, have a little extra fun naming your contact groups!"
